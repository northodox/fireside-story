    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>It is not actually raining; however, originally I had forgetten my umbrella. That was scary because I got covered in rain. Now the rain outside has ended but the inside rain is tumultuous. At least player 1 is sunshine and rainbows.</p>
    <p>"Inside rain again," Player 1 muttered. "I'm getting too old for this!"</p>
    <p>Thankfully, Player 2 was able to see the sunshine through the rain.</p>
    <p>The two players both agreed that this project would look better with some cascading style. Sheets of it, even!</p>
